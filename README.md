Reuse the common boilerplate for building/maintaining macOS/iOS projects.

# How

## GitHub actions

Employ reusable workflow, in assumption that necessary tooling/scripts are already part of the project.

## Tooling

Shared tooling/scripts are part of the Git submodule that is versioned *together* with GitHub the actions that employ them.
